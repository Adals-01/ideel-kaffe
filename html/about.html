            <h2>NESPRESSO compatible</h2>
            <p><strong>Our capsules are compatible with all Nespresso coffee machines. </strong>
                Just pop one in the top and you’re ready to go! Once your coffee’s been poured,
                 the capsule can go right into your home composting bin. More on that now... </p>
            <h2>“OK HOME COMPOST” CERTIFICATE</h2>
            <p>Our capsules perfectly demonstrate a <strong>circular economy</strong>; made from the earth and are returned right back to it. 
                It’s no surprise they were named  “the most environmentally friendly coffee capsule” by the Nova Institute in Germany.
                When sunflower oil is created the seed-shells are left as a by-product. 
                The shells are collected, and a biomass is created, which the capsule is made of. 
                It has achieved the prestigious <strong>“OK Home Compost” Certificate.</strong> 
                It means the product <strong>degrades under natural conditions</strong>, even in a garden compost.

            <h2>NATURALLY GROWN IN ETHIOPIA</h2>
            <p>For coffee to be labelled as “specialty” it has to meet special criteria and quality standards, 
                which is why it usually does not grow in big plantations but smaller batches, in perfect coffee farming environments.
                Each bean is hand-picked and carefully selected, depending on its age, shape, color etc. 
                Thanks to south Ethiopia’s perfect climate for growing coffee, there is no need for adding pesticides. 
                <strong>More than 90% of Ethiopian coffee is grown naturally.</strong></p>
            <h2>The harvest process</h2>    
            <p>The coffee is grown and harvested in the highlands, by <strong>small scale farming communities.</strong>
                This places are so remote they are only accessible by donkeys.
                Later it is either washed or dried, before being shipped to Copenhagen, where it is roasted.  </p>

            <h2>THE FARMERS</h2>
            <p><strong>We source coffee directly from the farmer </strong>for two main reasons. 
                To guarantee we get the best green beans, and to make sure the farmer is rewarded for the high quality coffee.
                We pay 25% more than the average Fair-trade price, 
                while also investing in long lasting projects developed by the local communities.</p>
            <h2>PROJECT WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES</h2>    
            <p>By drinking our coffee you leave a <strong>footprint on the world.</strong>  
                Each cup of coffee secures school uniforms, quality education and job creating projects in Ethiopia.  </p>
